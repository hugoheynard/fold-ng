# Changelog

All notable changes to **fold-ng** are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`fold-app-shell`** now sets the drawer's background `inert` via an attribute
  binding (`[attr.inert]`) rather than a property binding. No behaviour change —
  AOT was always clean — but it silences an `NG0303` "unknown property" warning
  raised by the JIT element-schema in dev/test runtimes.
- **Published tarball** no longer ships `tsconfig.lib.tsbuildinfo` — a ~100 kB
  TypeScript incremental-build cache that `finalize-dist` now prunes. Smaller
  install (14 → 13 files).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **`fold-app-shell` — the mobile drawer is now a real modal.** While open, the
  off-canvas primary rail is a named `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` (new
  `drawerLabel` input, default `"Menu"`), and every other region is `inert` so a
  screen reader can't wander behind it. New `drawerId` — exposed via
  `exportAs="foldAppShell"` — lets the app point its hamburger's `aria-controls`
  at the drawer (see the trigger contract in the component docs).

### Fixed

- **`fold-app-shell` skip-link** moves focus to `<main>` directly and prevents
  the fragment navigation, so it works under hash routing (`withHashLocation`),
  where a `#id` jump would otherwise be treated as a route change.

### Changed

- **`FoldComponentPanelDescriptor.ariaLabel`** is now typed `string | undefined`
  (was `string`) — a non-breaking widening; the descriptor always carries the key.
- **Internals hardened**, no API change: the library now compiles under
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `strictStandalone`,
  `typeCheckHostBindings`, and the full `strictTypeChecked` ESLint preset.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24

First public release line — **production-quality, pre-1.0 (`0.x`)**: fully
tested and dogfooded in a real application, but the component API may still be
refined before `1.0.0`. Consumed as standalone Angular 22 components plus a
design-token stylesheet.

> **1.0.0 is held** until every component in
> [`docs/RELEASE-READINESS.md`](./docs/RELEASE-READINESS.md) is 🟢🟢🟢. Until
> then `latest` tracks the newest `0.x` (pin your version — treat `0.x` minor
> bumps as potentially breaking); throwaway pre-release cuts ship on the `beta`
> dist-tag.

### Added

- **Design tokens** — two-tier model (primitives → semantic), four themes
  (`umbra` dark default, `lumen`, `bubbly`, `navi`) switched via `data-theme`, a
  typed catalogue + `foldColorVar()` helper, and a contract test locking theme
  parity.
- **Actions** — `[foldButton]` (applied to a real `<button>`/`<a>`; orthogonal
  `emphasis` × `intent`; `loading`; forced-colors), `fold-button-icon`,
  `fold-toggle-icon`, `fold-link`, `fold-spinner`.
- **Overlays** — `fold-panel-host` / `fold-panel-header`: modal side panels with
  an accessible name, an `inert` background barrier, a top-most focus trap,
  scroll-lock, and a typed imperative `open<TData, TResult>()` → `FoldPanelRef`.
- **Layout / Navigation / Content / Feedback / Forms / Foundations** — see the
  component table in the README.
- **Accessibility** — overlays honour the full modal contract; icons inherit
  `currentColor`; `prefers-reduced-motion` + `forced-colors` are respected;
  strings localise via inputs / providers (`provideFoldPanelLabels`).
